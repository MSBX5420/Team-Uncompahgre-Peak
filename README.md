We have downloaded the most up to date air quality data as of 4/12/2020 including all available data from 2019 as a comparison.
The data for each major cities is based on the average (median) of several stations. The data set provides min/max/median and standard deviation for each of the air pollutant species (PM2.5,PM10, Ozone ...) as well as meteorological data (Wind, Temperature, ...). All air pollutant species are converted to the US EPA standard (i.e. no raw concentrations). All dates are UTC based.
